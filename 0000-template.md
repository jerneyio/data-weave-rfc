# Summary
[summary]: #summary

A paragraph describing the feature

# Motivation
[motiviation]: #motiviation

Why should this feature be added? What issues does it help solve? What is the expected outcome?

# Documentation
[documentation]: #documentation

If this proposal was already in the language, how might the documentation for this feature look? How would you explain this feature to another DataWeave user? Is this a continuation of an existing DataWeave pattern, or a new one? You may need to:

* Introduce new concepts
* Explain the feature in terms of a large number of examples
* How are error scenarios handled? What if the parameters passed are not as expected?

How does this feature work with existing supported data formats? For example, how does the feature work with XML namespaces and attributes?

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should this feature _not_ be implemented in DataWeave?

# Rationale, Alternatives
[rationale]: #rationale

* What other designs have you considered and why did you not choose them?
* Why is this design better than alternatives?
* What is the impact of not adopting this change?

# Existing Implementations
[existing-implementations]: #existing-implementations

Discuss both the good and the bad of existing implementations of this feature, if applicable. A few examples:

* Does this feature exist in other programming languages? What experience has their community had?
* What lessons can we learn from existing implementations?
* Are there any papers or posts that already discuss this?

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

* What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this feature gets implemented?
* What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFB that could be address in the future?
* Have you considered how the feature will work outside of the scope of MuleSoft applications?
